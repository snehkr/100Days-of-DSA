### üå≥ Trees Basics :-

- **Definition :**

  - A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

  - Each node in a tree has a parent-child relationship with other nodes, except for the root node, which has no parent.

  - The node at the top of the hierarchy is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves.

  - The level of a node is its distance from the root, and the height of a tree is the maximum level of any node.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Tree :-

- **Definition :**

  - A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

- **Time Complexity :**

  - `Access/Search/Insert/Delete` O(log n) in average case for a balanced binary tree
  - O(n) in the `worst case` for an unbalanced binary tree.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Search Tree :-

- **Definition :**

  - A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left subtree of each node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

- **Time Complexity :**

  - `Access/Search/Insert/Delete` O(log n) on average

  - O(n) in the `worst case` for a skewed tree

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ AVL Tree :-

- **Definition :**

  - An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.

- **Time Complexity :**

  - `Access/Search/Insert/Delete` O(log n) on average

  - O(n) in the `worst case` for a skewed tree

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Heap Tree :-

- **Definition :**

  - A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

  - In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key of P is greater than or equal to the key of C.

- **Time Complexity :**

  - `Access/Insert :` O(1)

  - `Delete (Max) :` O(log n)
