### üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Dynamic Programming :-

- **Definition :**

  - Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful optimization technique used in computer science and mathematics to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to avoid redundant computations.

  - DP is particularly useful for problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.

- **Key Aspects :**

  - `Optimal Substructure`

    - A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

    - In other words, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems should lead to an optimal solution.

  - `Overlapping Subproblems`

    - Subproblems are solved independently, and their solutions are reused multiple times.

    - DP algorithms store the solutions to subproblems in a table (usually an array or a matrix) so that they are not recomputed.

  - `Memoization`

    - Memoization is a technique used in DP where the results of expensive function calls are stored and reused to avoid redundant computations.

    - In the context of DP, this often involves storing the results of subproblems in a data structure (e.g., an array or a hash table).

  - `Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down`

    - Bottom-Up: Solving the problem by solving its subproblems first and using their solutions to build up to the overall problem.

    - Top-Down: Solving the problem recursively by breaking it down into subproblems and solving them, typically using memoization to store solutions.

- **Types of Dynamic Programming :**

  - `Tabulation (Bottom-Up)`

    - Solving subproblems iteratively and storing their solutions in a table.

  - `Memoization (Top-Down)`

    - Solving subproblems recursively and storing their solutions, often using a memoization table.

- **Usage of Dynamic Programming :**

  - `Optimization Problems`

    - DP is commonly used to solve optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of feasible solutions.

  - `Shortest Path Problems`

    - DP is used in algorithms like Floyd-Warshall and Bellman-Ford for finding the shortest paths in a graph.

  - `String Matching`

    - DP algorithms are used in bioinformatics for sequence alignment and similarity searches.

  - `Resource Allocation Problems`

    - DP can be applied to problems involving resource allocation, such as job scheduling and project management.

- **Examples of DP Problems :**

  - `Fibonacci Sequence:`

    - Computing Fibonacci numbers using memoization or bottom-up tabulation.

  - `Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):`

    - Finding the longest subsequence common to two sequences.

  - `Knapsack Problem:`

    - Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items with a total weight not exceeding a given limit.

  - `Coin Change Problem:`

    - Determine the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a set of coins.
